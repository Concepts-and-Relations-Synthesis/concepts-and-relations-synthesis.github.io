# Concepts-and-Relations-Synthesis

We propose a knowledge graph approach to synthesize concepts and relations that are studied in social science publications on the topic of social media. We collected 16,185 Social Sciences Citation Index full-text publications (until the end of 2019) from Web of Science and synthesized concepts and relations for analysis. We present parts of the synthesized data [here](./Synthesized_Concepts_and_Relations.csv).
