<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">We propose a knowledge graph approach to synthesize concepts and relations that are studied in social science publications on the topic of social media. We collected 16,185 Social Sciences Citation Index full-text publications (until the end of 2019) from Web of Science and synthesized concepts and relations for analysis. We present parts of the synthesized data <a href="./Synthesized_Concepts_and_Relations.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">The data table includes 9,196 hypothesis statements that deep learning models automatically extract from 2,256 social science publications on the topic of social media. Each hypothesis statement corresponds to a row. For each hypothesis statement, the hypothesis ID, variable terms, and concepts of the variable terms that deep learning models extract are presented.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7"><em>Note</em>: The models extract four levels of concepts for the variable terms and we only present level-one concepts here. Besides, the models also extract properties of the relation in a hypothesis statement, such as whether the relation is empirically supported and its polarity.
